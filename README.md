# Gradient-Descent

Gradient Descent
In this lab session, you will gain practical knowledge on gradient descent.

The lab is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Solving Linear Regression
Part 2: Solving Logistic Regression
Learning goals
After this lab, you should be able to:

Have a clear understanding of gradient descent, how it works and how it is implemented
Understanding the role of the learning rate and the number of epochs in finding a solution
